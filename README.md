### Overviews:

### Note:
Git create a new branch and switch to current `git checkout -b my-branch` & `git branch -l` to list all branches.......

### Git Branch Management Workflow:
- `git log`, `git status` and `git diff` to get a overview of the current repo on this directory 
- `git branch`
- `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>` will create a new branch as specified and will checkout all-together. Then do `git add .` > `git commit ...` > `git push ...` sync with remote.
- `git checkout <existing-branch-name>` to select the current branch as working branch.
